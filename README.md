# Youtube Sentiment Analysis

## What does this app do?
It analyses the overall viewer feedback through comments on any youtube video. 

## What does the output look like?
The output for each comment will be the comment's sentiment score. The number of comments with Postive, Negative and Neutral sentiment scores are counted seperately and this is depicted as a chart using ChartJs. [A neutal comment is taken as postive]

## Why this app?
I have always wondered how friendly the comment section of a video is. With its help, it is easy to get a vague idea on the kind of content that being made by that particular channel. Also, the current youtube analytics seems to be more focused on the number of views, likes, shares and comments. So a content creator doesn't get to see the big picture. Moreover, it is not possible for a content creator to go through every comment and infer how friendly the comments are overall.

So to help, this app analyses a youtube video and provides the number of postive and negative comments in the form of a chart.

## Limitations
1. Since this app uses classic sentiment analysis, sarcasm is not handled very well.
2. The app is limited to English for now.
